# HEURISTIC METHODS 
Metaheuristics are optimization techniques, they are used to find good solutions (in a good time) to combination problems (not the best solution).

## Traveling Salesman Problem 
It is a standard problem that consist of a salesman whom need to visit "n" cities. While traveling he can't pass twice at the same city, and have to stop in the first city.
Best solution is one the salesman make his circuit in the minimum distance.

## Genetic Algorithms 
Genetic Algorithms (GA): Inspired by natural selection, they use operators like selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over multiple generations.
